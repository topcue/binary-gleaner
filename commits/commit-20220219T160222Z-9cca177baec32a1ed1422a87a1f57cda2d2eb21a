    "message": "gdb/darwin: remove not-so-harmless spurious call to `wait4`\n\nAs seen in https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24069 this\ncode will typically wait4() a second time on the same process that was\nalready wait4()'d a few lines above. While this used to be\nharmless/idempotent (when we assumed that the process already exited),\nthis now causes a deadlock in the WIFSTOPPED case.\n\nThe early (~2019) history of bug #24069 cautiously suggests to use\nWNOHANG instead of outright deleting the call. However, tests on the\ncurrent version of Darwin (Big Sur) demonstrate that gdb runs just fine\nwithout a redundant call to wait4(), as would be expected.\nNotwithstanding the debatable value of conserving bug compatibility with\nan OS release that is more than a decade old, there is scant evidence of\nwhat that double-wait4() was supposed to achieve in the first place - A\ncursory investigation with `git blame` pinpoints commits bb00b29d7802\nand a80b95ba67e2 from the 2008-2009 era, but fails to answer the\n\"why\" question conclusively.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Philippe Blain <levraiphilippeblain@gmail.com>\nChange-Id: Id4e4415d66d6ff6b3552b60d761693f17015e4a0",
