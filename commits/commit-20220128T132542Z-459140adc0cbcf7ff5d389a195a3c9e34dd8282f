    "message": "Add top-level .editorconfig file\n\nAdd a .editorconfig [1] file.  This helps configure editors\nautomatically with the right whitespace settings.  It will help me,\nsince I need to juggle with different whitespace settings for different\nprojects.   But I think it can also help newcomers get things right from\nthe start.\n\nSome editors have native support for reading these files, while others\nrequire a plug-in [2].  And if you don't want to use it, then this file\ndoesn't change anything to your life.\n\nI added rules for the kinds of files I edit most often, but more can be\nadded later.  I assumed that the rules were the same for GDB and the\nother projects, but if that's not the case, we can always put\n.editorconfig files in project subdirectories to override settings.\n\n[1] https://editorconfig.org/\n[2] https://editorconfig.org/#download\n\nChange-Id: Ifda136d13877fafcf0d137fec8501f6a34e1367b",
