This removes the need to eyeball for all\nsuffixes, which lead to the original duplication.\n\nAlso add a lot more combinations, testing all comparison operators\ncomprehensively.  The result is 262 unique tests vs 104 before this\npatch.\n\nTested on x86_86-linux.\n\nChange-Id: Id215a3d610aa8e032bf06ee160b5e3aed4a92d1e",
