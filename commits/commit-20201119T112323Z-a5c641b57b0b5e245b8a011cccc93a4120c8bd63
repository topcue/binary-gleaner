    "message": "gdb/fortran: Add support for Fortran array slices at the GDB prompt\n\nThis commit brings array slice support to GDB.\n\nWARNING: This patch contains a rather big hack which is limited to\nFortran arrays, this can be seen in gdbtypes.c and f-lang.c.  More\ndetails on this below.\n\nThis patch rewrites two areas of GDB's Fortran support, the code to\nextract an array slice, and the code to print an array.\n\nAfter this commit a user can, from the GDB prompt, ask for a slice of\na Fortran array and should get the correct result back.  Slices can\n(optionally) have the lower bound, upper bound, and a stride\nspecified.  Slices can also have a negative stride.\n\nFortran has the concept of repacking array slices.  Within a compiled\nFortran program if a user passes a non-contiguous array slice to a\nfunction then the compiler may have to repack the slice, this involves\ncopying the elements of the slice to a new area of memory before the\ncall, and copying the elements back to the original array after the\ncall.  Whether repacking occurs will depend on which version of\nFortran is being used, and what type of function is being called.\n\nThis commit adds support for both packed, and unpacked array slicing,\nwith the default being unpacked.\n\nWith an unpacked array slice, when the user asks for a slice of an\narray GDB creates a new type that accurately describes where the\nelements of the slice can be found within the original array, a\nvalue of this type is then returned to the user.  The address of an\nelement within the slice will be equal to the address of an element\nwithin the original array.\n\nA user can choose to select packed array slices instead using:\n\n  (gdb) set fortran repack-array-slices on|off\n  (gdb) show fortran repack-array-slices\n\nWith packed array slices GDB creates a new type that reflects how the\nelements of the slice would look if they were laid out in contiguous\nmemory, allocates a value of this type, and then fetches the elements\nfrom the original array and places then into the contents buffer of\nthe new value.\n\nOne benefit of using packed slices over unpacked slices is the memory\nusage, taking a small slice of N elements from a large array will\nrequire (in GDB) N * ELEMENT_SIZE bytes of memory, while an unpacked\narray will also include all of the \"padding\" between the\nnon-contiguous elements.  There are new tests added that highlight\nthis difference.\n\nThere is also a new debugging flag added with this commit that\nintroduces these commands:\n\n  (gdb) set debug fortran-array-slicing on|off\n  (gdb) show debug fortran-array-slicing\n\nThis prints information about how the array slices are being built.\n\nAs both the repacking, and the array printing requires GDB to walk\nthrough a multi-dimensional Fortran array visiting each element, this\ncommit adds the file f-array-walk.h, which introduces some\ninfrastructure to support this process.  This means the array printing\ncode in f-valprint.c is significantly reduced.\n\nThe only slight issue with this commit is the \"rather big hack\" that I\nmentioned above.  This hack allows us to handle one specific case,\narray slices with negative strides.  This is something that I don't\nbelieve the current GDB value contents model will allow us to\ncorrectly handle, and rather than rewrite the value contents code\nright now, I'm hoping to slip this hack in as a work around.\n\nThe problem is that, as I see it, the current value contents model\nassumes that an object base address will be the lowest address within\nthat object, and that the contents of the object start at this base\naddress and occupy the TYPE_LENGTH bytes after that.\n\n( We do have the embedded_offset, which is used for C++ sub-classes,\nsuch that an object can start at some offset from the content buffer,\nhowever, the assumption that the object then occupies the next\nTYPE_LENGTH bytes is still true within GDB. )\n\nThe problem is that Fortran arrays with a negative stride don't follow\nthis pattern.  In this case the base address of the object points to\nthe element with the highest address, the contents of the array then\nstart at some offset _before_ the base address, and proceed for one\nelement _past_ the base address.\n\nAs the stride for such an array would be negative then, in theory the\nTYPE_LENGTH for this type would also be negative.  However, in many\nplaces a value in GDB will degrade to a pointer + length, and the\nlength almost always comes from the TYPE_LENGTH.\n\nIt is my belief that in order to correctly model this case the value\ncontent handling of GDB will need to be reworked to split apart the\nvalue's content buffer (which is a block of memory with a length), and\nthe object's in memory base address and length, which could be\nnegative.\n\nThings are further complicated because arrays with negative strides\nlike this are always dynamic types.  When a value has a dynamic type\nand its base address needs resolving we actually store the address of\nthe object within the resolved dynamic type, not within the value\nobject itself.\n\nIn short I don't currently see an easy path to cleanly support this\nsituation within GDB.  And so I believe that leaves two options,\neither add a work around, or catch cases where the user tries to make\nuse of a negative stride, or access an array with a negative stride,\nand throw an error.\n\nThis patch currently goes with adding a work around, which is that\nwhen we resolve a dynamic Fortran array type, if the stride is\nnegative, then we adjust the base address to point to the lowest\naddress required by the array.  The printing and slicing code is aware\nof this adjustment and will correctly slice and print Fortran arrays.\n\nWhere this hack will show through to the user is if they ask for the\naddress of an array in their program with a negative array stride, the\naddress they get from GDB will not match the address that would be\ncomputed within the Fortran program.\n\ngdb/ChangeLog:\n\n\t* Makefile.in (HFILES_NO_SRCDIR): Add f-array-walker.h.\n\t* NEWS: Mention new options.\n\t* f-array-walker.h: New file.\n\t* f-lang.c: Include 'gdbcmd.h' and 'f-array-walker.h'.\n\t(repack_array_slices): New static global.\n\t(show_repack_array_slices): New function.\n\t(fortran_array_slicing_debug): New static global.\n\t(show_fortran_array_slicing_debug): New function.\n\t(value_f90_subarray): Delete.\n\t(skip_undetermined_arglist): Delete.\n\t(class fortran_array_repacker_base_impl): New class.\n\t(class fortran_lazy_array_repacker_impl): New class.\n\t(class fortran_array_repacker_impl): New class.\n\t(fortran_value_subarray): Complete rewrite.\n\t(set_fortran_list): New static global.\n\t(show_fortran_list): Likewise.\n\t(_initialize_f_language): Register new commands.\n\t(fortran_adjust_dynamic_array_base_address_hack): New function.\n\t* f-lang.h (fortran_adjust_dynamic_array_base_address_hack):\n\tDeclare.\n\t* f-valprint.c: Include 'f-array-walker.h'.\n\t(class fortran_array_printer_impl): New class.\n\t(f77_print_array_1): Delete.\n\t(f77_print_array): Delete.\n\t(fortran_print_array): New.\n\t(f_value_print_inner): Update to call fortran_print_array.\n\t* gdbtypes.c: Include 'f-lang.h'.\n\t(resolve_dynamic_type_internal): Call\n\tfortran_adjust_dynamic_array_base_address_hack.\n\ngdb/testsuite/ChangeLog:\n\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices-bad.exp: New file.\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices-bad.f90: New file.\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices-sub-slices.exp: New file.\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices-sub-slices.f90: New file.\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices.exp: Rewrite tests.\n        * gdb.fortran/array-slices.f90: Rewrite tests.\n        * gdb.fortran/vla-sizeof.exp: Correct expected results.\n\ngdb/doc/ChangeLog:\n\n        * gdb.texinfo (Debugging Output): Document 'set/show debug\n        fortran-array-slicing'.\n        (Special Fortran Commands): Document 'set/show fortran\n        repack-array-slices'.",
