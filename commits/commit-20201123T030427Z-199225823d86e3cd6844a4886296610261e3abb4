    "message": "gdb/testsuite: add template for test cases\n\nThe wiki contains a template for new test cases:\n\n    https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDBTestcaseCookbook#Building_the_Example_Program\n\n... which is helpful, because even after many years I can't write all\nthe boilerplate for writing a test case without doing some mistakes.\n\nHowever, I think it would be nice to have it in the tree.  It's much\nfaster to cp the files than going to the wiki and copy/pasting the\ncontents.\n\nAs a bonus, the copyright years will get updated in these files, unlike\nthose in the wiki.  So they will always be good when we start a new\ntest.\n\nIf this patch is merged, I plan to change the wiki to just point to\nthese files.\n\ngdb/testsuite/ChangeLog:\n\n\t* gdb.base/template.exp: New.\n\t* gdb.base/template.c: New.\n\nChange-Id: I7dbf068a043b48f83cc325087d70e868eee998c6",
