    "message": "Delete unnecessary code from kill_command\n\nI believe this comment:\n\n      /* Killing off the inferior can leave us with a core file.  If\n\t so, print the state we are left in.  */\n\nReferred to the fact that a decade ago, by design, GDB would let you\ntype \"run\" when debugging a core dump, keeping the core open.  That\n\"run\" would push a process_stratum target on the target stack for the\nlive process, and, the core would remain open -- we used to have a\ncore_stratum.  When the live process was killed/detached or exited,\nGDB would go back to debugging the core, since the core_stratum target\nwas now at the top of the stack.  That design had a number of\nproblems, see here for example:\n\n  https://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2008-08/msg00290.html\n\nIn 2010, core_stratum was finaly eliminated and cores now have\nprocess_stratum too, with commit c0edd9edadfe (\"Make core files the\nprocess_stratum.\").  Pushing a live process on the stack while you're\ndebugging a core discards the core completely.\n\nI also thought that this might be in use with checkpoints, but it does\nnot -- \"kill\" when you have multiple checkpoints kills all the\ncheckpoints.\n\ngdb/ChangeLog:\n2020-01-10  Pedro Alves  <palves@redhat.com>\n\n\t* infcmd.c (kill_command): Remove dead code.",
