    "message": "gdbsupport: regenerate Makefile.in\n\nI had cause to regenerate gdbsupport/Makefile.in, and noticed some\nunexpected changes in the copyright header dates.\n\nI suspect that this was caused by the end of year date range update\nprocess.\n\nThe Makefile.in contains two date ranges.  The first range appears to\nbe the date range for the version of automake being used, that is the\nrange runs up to 2017 only, when automake 1.15.1 was released.\n\nThe second date range in Makefile.in represents the date range for the\ngenerated file, and so, now runs up to 2022.\n\nAnyway, this is the result of running autoreconf (using automake\n1.15.1) in the gdbsupport directory.",
