    "message": "gdbserver: small cleanup of README file\n\nFix a few outdated or incoherent things in the README:\n\n- Don't mention remote.c nor *-stub.c files as references for the remote\n  protocol.  remote.c is in GDB, not GDBserver, and *-stub.c files don't\n  exist today.  Add a link to the documentation instead.\n\n- In the \"server (target) side\" section, use `:2345` instead of\n  `host:2345`.  It currently says that using `host:2345` means we would\n  expect a connection from `host`.  That's not what I would expect by\n  passing a host part here.  If I passed `11.22.33.44:2345` as the listen\n  address, I would expect it to instruct gdbserver to listen only on that\n  (11.22.33.44) network interface, not to expect a connection from host\n  `11.22.33.44`.  So, remove that part of the sentence.\n\n- Remove the list of supported target, refer to configure.srv instead.\n  Keeping a list here is bound to lose sync with reality.\n\n- In the cross-compile instructions, I don't think it's necessary to mention\n  \"In a Bourne shell\".\n\n- In the cross-compile instructions, I don't know what passing\n  `your-target-name` to configure does, I don't think it's valid.  Use\n  `make all-gdbserver` as in the instructions just above.\n\ngdbserver/ChangeLog:\n\n\t* README: Fix a few outdated or incoherent things.\n\nChange-Id: I79349e25bc1bc53447855e0dea6cc7b9630f4553",
