    "message": "New core file tests with mappings over existing program memory\n\nThis test case was inspired by Pedro's demonstration of a problem\nwith my v2 patches.  It can be found here:\n\n    https://sourceware.org/pipermail/gdb-patches/2020-May/168826.html\n\nIn a nutshell, my earlier patches could not handle the case in\nwhich a read-only mapping created with mmap() was created at\nan address used by other file-backed read-only memory in use by\nthe process.\n\nThis problem has been fixed (for Linux, anyway) by the commit \"Use\nNT_FILE note section for reading core target memory\".\n\nWhen I run this test without any of my recent corefile patches,\nI see these failures:\n\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: kernel core: print/x mbuf_ro[0]@4\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: kernel core: print/x mbuf_ro[pagesize-4]@4\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: kernel core: print/x mbuf_ro[-3]@6\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: kernel core: print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize-3]@6\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: kernel core: print/x mbuf_ro[pagesize-3]@6\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: maint print core-file-backed-mappings\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: gcore core: print/x mbuf_ro[-3]@6\n\nThe ones involving mbuf_ro will almost certainly fail when run on\nnon-Linux systems; I've used setup_xfail on those tests to prevent\nthem from outright FAILing when not run on Linux.  For a time, I\nhad considered skipping these tests altogether when not run on\nLinux, but I changed my mind due to this failure...\n\nFAIL: gdb.base/corefile2.exp: print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize-3]@6\n\nI think it *should* pass without my recent corefile patches.  The fact\nthat it doesn't is likely due to a bug in GDB.  The following\ninteraction with GDB demonstrates the problem:\n\n(gdb) print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize-3]@6\n$1 = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}\n(gdb) print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize]@3\n$2 = {0x6b, 0x6b, 0x6b}\n\nThe last three values in display of $1 should be the same as those\nshown by $2.  Like this...\n\n(gdb) print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize-3]@6\n$1 = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x6b, 0x6b, 0x6b}\n(gdb) print/x mbuf_rw[pagesize]@3\n$2 = {0x6b, 0x6b, 0x6b}\n\nThat latter output was obtained with the use of all of my current\ncorefile patches.  I see no failures on Linux when running this test\nwith my current set of corefile patches.  I tested 3 architectures:\nx86_64, s390x, and aarch64.\n\nI also tested on FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE.  I see the following results\nboth with and without the current set of core file patches:\n\n    # of expected passes\t\t26\n    # of expected failures\t\t8\n\nOf particular interest is that I did *not* see the problematic mbuf_rw\nfailure noted earlier (both with and without the core file patches).\nI still don't have an explanation for why this failure occurred on\nLinux.  Prior to running the tests, I had hypothesized that I'd see\nthis failure on FreeBSD too, but testing shows that this is not the\ncase.\n\nAlso of importance is that we see no FAILs with this test on FreeBSD\nwhich indicates that I XFAILed the correct tests.\n\nThis version runs the interesting tests twice, once with a kernel\ncreated core file and another time with a gcore created core file.\n\nIt also does a very minimal test of the new command \"maint print\ncore-file-backed-mappings\".\n\ngdb/testsuite/ChangeLog:\n\n\t* gdb.base/corefile2.exp: New file.\n\t* gdb.base/coremaker2.exp: New file.",
